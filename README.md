# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

In this module I learned how to use access keys from third-party APIs and implement them into a useful application like a weather dashboard. Bootstrap was used in the HTML file with some hard coding in CSS. The star of the show is Javascript alongside with Jquery. Psuedo coding can be seen all over each file helping other developers if come across this repository. 

# The Challenge

Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys.
